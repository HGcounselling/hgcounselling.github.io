					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<h5>What do I need to do first?</h5>
					<p>You just need to send me an email. Then I’ll arrange a short, free chat with you. Therapy works better if you get on with your counsellor so this is a chance to meet me and see if you think it’s a good fit. Then, if you choose to, we can sort out a time and date for our first session.</p>
					<h5>What happens in the first session?</h5>
					<p>It’s normal to feel a bit nervous about your first session. It’s ok if you don’t feel comfortable talking about yourself with a stranger, or if you just want to offload and talk non stop.</p>
					<p>In our first session we’ll spend some time talking through some practical bits like how to contact me, payments and cancellations. I can also tell you a bit more about how I work and what to expect. And then I’ll ask you why you wanted counselling and what you’d like to get out of it. It’s ok not to have all the answers, this is something we can work out together.</p>
					<h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
					<p>Each session will cost £55.</p>
					<h5>Where is it?</h5>
					<p>For face-to-face sessions, I’m based just <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kd5Jxd5MGaeZdv7w6" target="_blank">north of Cambridge in Impington</a>. When meeting online, I usually use Google Meet.</p>
					<h5>How long are the sessions?</h5>
					<p>Each session will last 50 minutes.</p>
					<h5>How many sessions will I need?</h5>
					<p>I recommend starting with 6 sessions. How many more you want after that will depend on things like your budget and what you want to get out of counselling. We can talk about what works best for you, and whatever we decide you are always in control and can stop whenever you like.</p>
					<h5>How do I find the right counsellor for me?</h5>
					<p>It can be really difficult to trawl through different counsellor’s websites trying to find the right one! I’d recommend finding 2 or 3 people you like the look of and then having a chat with them to see who you get on with.</p>
					<h5>What kind of counsellor are you? What are your qualifications? Who do you work with? Who are you!?</h5>
					<p>I’ve tried to answer these questions <a href="/#about-me">here</a>.</p>
