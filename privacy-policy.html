					<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
					<p>Your privacy is very important to me and you can be confident that your personal information will be kept safe and secure and will only be used for the purpose it was given to me. I adhere to current data protection legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (the GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.</p>
					<p>This privacy notice tells you what I will do with your personal information from initial point of contact through to after your therapy has ended. I am happy to chat through any questions you might have about my data protection policy and you can contact me via email.</p>
					<p>‘Data controller’ is the term used to describe the person/ organisation that collects and stores and has responsibility for people’s personal data. In this instance, the data controller is me.</p>
					<!-- <p>I am registered with the <a href="#">Information Commissioner’s Office [Insert registration number]</a>.</p> -->
					<h4>My lawful basis for holding and using your personal information</h4>
					<p>The GDPR states that I must have a lawful basis for processing your personal data. There are different lawful bases depending on the stage at which I am processing your data. I have explained these below:</p>
					<p>If you have had therapy with me and it has now ended, I will use legitimate interest as my lawful basis for holding and using your personal information.</p>
					<p>If you are currently having therapy or if you are in contact with me to consider therapy, I will process your personal data where it is necessary for the performance of our contract.</p>
					<p>The GDPR also makes sure that I look after any sensitive personal information that you may disclose to me appropriately. This type of information is called ‘special category personal information’. The lawful basis for me processing any special categories of personal information is consent initially. I will then retain any counselling records in case of the need to reference them in the future (the official legal basis is to defend against potential legal claims).</p>
					<h4>How I use your information</h4>
					<h5>Initial contact</h5>
					<p>When you contact me with an enquiry about my counselling services I will collect information to help me satisfy your enquiry. This will include your name and contact details such as email address and phone number. A trusted individual may give me your details when making an enquiry on your behalf.</p>
					<p>If you decide not to proceed I will ensure all your personal data is deleted within 12 months. If you would like me to delete this information sooner, just let me know.</p>
					<h5>While you are accessing counselling</h5>
					<p>Rest assured that everything you discuss with me is confidential. That confidentiality will only be broken if:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If I believe there is a danger that you may cause serious harm to yourself or to another person</li>
						<li>If a Child Safeguarding issue emerges during counselling or concerns arise around the safety of a vulnerable adult.</li>
						<li>If you disclose information relating to acts of terrorism or money laundering. I am legally bound to report any disclosures to the relevant authorities without consultation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I will always try to speak to you about this first, unless there are safeguarding issues that prevent this.</p>
					<p>I will keep a record of your personal details to help the counselling services run smoothly. These details are kept securely on a laptop and are not shared with any third party. This will include name, address, contact details, GP details and emergency contact details.</p>
					<p>For security reasons I do not retain text messages for more than 3 months. If there is relevant information contained in a text message I will store it with my case notes on my laptop. Likewise, any email correspondence will be deleted after12 months if it is not important.</p>
					<h5>After counselling has ended.</h5>
					<p>Once counselling has ended your records will be kept for seven years from the end of our contact with each other and are then securely destroyed. If you want me to delete your information sooner than this, please tell me.</p>
					<h4>Your rights</h4>
					<p>I try to be as open as I can be in terms of giving people access to their personal information. You have a right to ask me to delete your personal information, to limit how I use your personal information, or to stop processing your personal information. You also have a right to ask for a copy of any information that I hold about you and to object to the use of your personal data in some circumstances. You can read more about your rights at <a href="http://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters">ico.org.uk/your-data-matters</a>.</p>
					<p>If I do hold information about you I will:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>give you a description of it and where it came from;</li>
						<li>tell you why I am holding it, tell you how long I will store your data and how I made this decision;</li>
						<li>tell you who it could be disclosed to;</li>
						<li>let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Data security</h4>
					<p>I take the security of the data I hold about you very seriously and as such I take every effort to make sure it is kept secure. I store all information on a laptop that is only used by me and is password protected.</p>
