					<h2>Hi, I'm Hannah, a qualified and registered therapist</h2>
					<h4>I offer therapy online and in person close to Cambridge (Histon & Impington)</h4>
					<p>I'm here to help you with whatever you're going through. Whether it's mental health difficulties in daily life, making sense of your past, or understanding yourself better - I'm here to support you.</p>
					<p>There are so many reasons behind why we think, feel, and act the way we do, and I can help untangle those complexities. I don't have all the answers (I wish!), but I do have the training and experience to support you in understanding your own experiences more fully.</p>
					<p>I know finding the right therapist can feel really hard, and research shows that the therapeutic relationship is vital to good outcomes. If you feel like we might be a good fit, feel free to get in touch for a free 20 minute chat.</p>

					<h2>About my style and training</h2>
					<p>Starting counselling can feel really daunting. It can be hard to think about opening up about your feelings, thoughts and behaviours to a stranger. I want to create an hour a week in your life which is just for you, where you don't have to worry about what anyone else is thinking or feeling, and you can be free to be yourself without any judgement. I'll make you feel safe and comfortable, so that we can openly explore whatever challenges you're facing and find ways to make things feel better.</p>
					<p>Therapists tend to use lots of different terms to describe how they work. I'm an ‘integrative therapist' which means that I use a mix of approaches and tailor these to suit each person. The different approaches I most use are person-centered, CBT and psychodynamic. It doesn't matter if you don't know what these mean, but here's a quick explanation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Person-centered. You are the expert in your own life and I will accept and value you as you are, without judgement or conditions. I will help you to find your own solutions to reach your potential.</li>
						<li>CBT. This focuses on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Together, we can work on changing unhelpful patterns using practical tools like journaling.</li>
						<li>Psychodynamic therapy helps to bring what's just below the surface—like deep memories or emotions—into your awareness. This can help you understand how these hidden feelings affect you now and find ways to cope with them.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Alongside my private practice, I also work for an amazing charity called <a href="https://www.cambridgeacornproject.org.uk/">Cambridge Acorn Project</a>, supporting young people and families who have experienced trauma and abuse. I take a trauma-informed approach to all my work.</p>
