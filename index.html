					<h2>Hi, I'm Hannah. Are you looking for someone to talk to?</h2>
					<h4>I offer therapy to adults and young people close to Cambridge (Histon & Impington)</h4>
					<p>I believe that the connection between the therapist and you is what makes therapy work. When you feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable, honest, and just a little curious about yourself, that's when real change can happen. I will take the time to really understand you – what it's like to be you, and how your world works. That's when we can start exploring things like why you feel or act the way you do, and how to create some space to figure out how to make changes that'll help you feel better.</p>

					<h2>About my style and training</h2>
					<p>I'm a trauma-informed integrative therapist. I've worked with all sorts of people, but I'm especially passionate about helping those who are recovering from tough or traumatic life experiences. It's not easy to move on from difficult times, and it can often feel like you're stuck, and change can feel out of reach.</p>
					<p>I understand that starting therapy can feel daunting, but we'll do it in a compassionate way that feels right for you. And it's not just about talking through what may have already happened – it's also about figuring out how to break old patterns, taking control of your thoughts and actions, and starting to do things differently so you can feel more in control and at peace. I believe that this approach also works well for things like anxiety, depression and low self-esteem too.</p>
					<p>I work with adults and young people, and am happy to meet online or in person. In addition to my private practice, I'm lucky enough to work with the amazing <a href="https://www.cambridgeacornproject.org.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Acorn Project</a>, where I support children and young people who've been through abuse or neglect.</p>
